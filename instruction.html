    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the head of the document there is a JavaScript variable, datamodel,
        that contains a JSON data set for use in populating the dropdowns in the
        form, below.
      </li>
      <li>On page load, bind the province dropdown using the data model.</li>
      <li>On province selection, populate the city dropdown.</li>
      <li>
        On city selection, display the description of the city from the data
        model (bonus points if shown on an embedded Google map or similar).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place these instructions (and notes) into a collapsible element that can
        be hidden with a click or allow them to be shown in a modal overlay
        (with UI element showing instructions are available).
      </li>
      <li>
        When the form is submitted, validate the fields are all populated
        (address 2 is optional).

        If the form validates, hide the form and display the submitted values in

        provided answers.
